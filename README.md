# M3_Wiper_Control_System
This project is to initiate the automatic wiper action by sensing the intensity of the rain or snow and thus increasing or decreasing the wiper speed accordingly. This automatic wiper system has a sensing unit, a controller which has STM32F407VG Microcontroller at its core and a motor unit which moves the arm of the wiper thus facilitating the wiping action.
